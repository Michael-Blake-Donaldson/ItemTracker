Item Tracker

+ SUMMARY

   The "Corner Grocer" application was designed to be an item tracker for all produce for a grocery store. It allows a user to search for products to visualize the amount of that item was sold highlighting popular produce.

+ WHAT DID I DO WELL?

   I am proud of the layout of my histogram in this project. The "+" sign gave appropriate spacing and allowed for an easy to read experience when searching for an item.

+ HOW CAN I ENHANCE MY CODE?

  I would start off by adding searching by dates as well. Being able to see which product was popular during different times of the year would be helpful for a business such as a gorcery store. Also if the tracker was to expand beyond produce, I would like to add
  searching by category to enhance the users experience and allow for greater efficiency.
  
+ WHICH PIECE OF CODE WAS MOST CHALLENGING?

   Managing the imports on a wide range of files was hard to keep track after creating 10+ files. It goes to show how organization. comments, whitespace, etc can all have a big impact on your code. Keeping your files in in order of process helps alot when
  you start a large project and thats what I did to help with organization. Google may always be a top spot as a resource, but peers that work on the same projects that you do are always going to be a reliable resource! 

+ WHAT SKILLS WILL BE TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER PROJECTS?

   Memory management is a HUGE skill that I never practiced before learning C++. Its an important skill/topic to understand and using that knowledge on various projects even while using different languages will be extremely helpful.

+ HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS PROGRAM MAINTAINABLE, READABLE, AND ADAPTABLE?

   All files are organized in away where they are easily accesible by name. Whitespaces are appropriate for easier readability. Comments are in all files and in specific spots to help the reader understand all parts of the program. The program also allows
  for easy changes and additions.
